Analyzing  PGA Tour Player Statistics and number of wins and top 10 finishes.


## TO DO:
X change nans to 0 for wins and top 10s  
X for each year rank each statistical category - this will nearly double the number of columns - how will ties be handled?  
x Look at the distribution of the statistics, how much do they vary between the players?
x make heat map of just wins/top 10s vs the traditional statistics, another with strokes gained statistics, and two more with the ranks for each
_ Look at the player with the most wins/top 10s each year, where did they rank?
_ violin plots with top players plotted - swarmplot or stripplot


Notes: Scatter plot of interesting points
Could look at changes throught years
